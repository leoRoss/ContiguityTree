ContiguityTree
==============

A Contiguity Tree is a nested structure of contiguous groups of Objects. It takes in various demonstrations (a permutation of a list of unique Objects). It implicitly tracks all subgroups of these Objects which have been contiguous in all previous demonstrations. The tree structure allows for the Objects to be easily traversed in a manner that respects these groupings. ContiguityTree has been supplemented to also respect preconditions between Objects.
